Simple recipe site as per Odin Foundation Project: Recipes

This first project will consist of basic HTML work. This should partly be review for me as I am no stranger to HTML but I have strictly used it in the Shopify enviorment so my work is limited and without foundation.

I am using this as an opportunity to start some basic work for what may eventually be a recipes section on our family website Downey.World
